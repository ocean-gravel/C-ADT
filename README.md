# My Data Structures Library in C

## Overview

This ongoing project is a library of fundamental data structures implemented in C, aimed at providing reusable abstract data types and structures. It includes data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables with generic data handling capabilities. Each data structure comes with functions to add, delete, search, and manage data effectively. (At attempt will be made :) ) 

This project is meant to both further my understanding in Data Structures and for some twisted reason to become more competent in the C programming language.

The design and implementation of some data structures and their associated functions in this library were inspired by "Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 6th Edition" by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser. Although this library is implemented in C, many of the methods and algorithms follow the structure and logic outlined in the book.
